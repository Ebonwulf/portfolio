        <h2>General knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a hard working person and I am always eager for a challenge. I
          have a great many hobbies, including: knitting, leatherwork,
          embroidery and jigsaw puzzles - just to name a few. I love reading,
          playing computer games with my friends and baking with my children in
          my spare time.
        </p>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently part of a full-time, 12-week Software Development
          program at _nology, gaining hands-on experience in: JavaScript (ES6),
          React, figma, SCSS, HTML, Java, SpringBoot and GCP. I was product
          owner for our group client project for one sprint, this enabled me to
          gain knowledge of how projects work on a broader scale and gave me
          team management skills. I have also studied several Udemy online
          courses including: 2D game development using C# with unity, compTia A+
          and Python.
